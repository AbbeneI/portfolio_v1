Soundify users can log in to search for playlists, artists, and albums and add them to their playlists. Soundify is built with Python and Django, connects to a Postgresql database hosted by AWS, and calls the Spotify API with the Spotipy Python library. It's coded with RESTful API calls and has full create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations on playlists. The UI is designed in Figma and styled with a custom design system built using CSS3, including flexbox and grid layouts.",
