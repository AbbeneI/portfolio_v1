            <p>
                I first became interested in coding when I built a website for a running club I joined in college. The results of my first project were mixed, but it ignited a love of HTML and CSS that continues today.

            <p>
                My primary objective is to create accessible and responsive products for the web. Drawing from my background in user experience and design, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to every project I work on. This ensures that the end result not only meets technical requirements but also serves users.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not immersed in coding, I enjoy making art, exploring Hyrule, and playing a never-ending game of fetch with my Husky mix Percy.
