                        I first became interested in coding when I built a website for my college running clubâ€”it ignited a love of HTML and CSS that continues to influence my work today.

                        My primary objective is to create accessible and responsive products for the web. Drawing from my background in user experience and design, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to every project I work on. This ensures that the end result not only meets technical requirements but also serves users.

                        When I'm not immersed in coding, I enjoy making art, exploring Hyrule, and playing a never-ending game of fetch with my Husky mix Percy.
