            <p>
                I first became interested in coding when I tried to build a website for a running club I joined in college. The results of my first project were mixed, but it ignited a love of HTML and CSS that continues to support my work today.

            <p>
                My primary objective is to create accessible and responsive products for the web. Drawing from my background in user experience and design, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to every project I undertake, ensuring that the end result not only meets technical requirements but also delights users.

                When I'm not immersed in coding, I enjoy digital painting, tabletop game sessions with my friends, and playing a never-ending game of fetch with my Husky mix Percy.
